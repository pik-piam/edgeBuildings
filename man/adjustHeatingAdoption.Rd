\title{Adjust Regional Heating Adoption Rates}
\usage{
adjustHeatingAdoption(df, config, lambda, lambdaDelta)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing historical and projected data for heating variables.}

\item{config}{A configuration data frame specifying scenario-specific parameters,
including decay rates, target years, and historical period endpoints.}

\item{lambda}{A data frame specifying transition factors for delta adjustments.}

\item{lambdaDelta}{A data frame containing precomputed delta transition values.}
}
\value{
A data frame with adjusted space heating useful energy demand projections.
}
\description{
This function corrects space heating useful energy demand projections that were
initially derived using a global fit. It refines these projections by incorporating
projections of future adoption rates of space heating technologies
while accounting for regional trends, historical data, and global convergence.
The projection is based on a regression-derived slope and follows either
a constant or asymptotic adjustment, depending on a threshold condition.
}
\details{
The method follows these key steps:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Historical Trend Estimation:} A linear regression is performed on historical
adoption rates (space heating per HDD) to determine the regional trend.
\item \strong{Threshold-Based Projection:} The threshold is defined such that only regions
with a positive relative slope (as a percentage change per unit increase over time)
are considered for continued growth and convergence. Regions that do not meet
this criterion maintain a constant adoption rate at their last historical value.
\item \strong{Global Convergence:} Regional projections gradually align with a global estimate by 2070.
\item \strong{Deviation Adjustments:} Deviations between model projections and historical data are
computed separately for regional and global approaches, ensuring consistency.
\item \strong{Short- to Mid-Term Adjustments:} The initial continuation/convergence of the adoption
rate is accounted for, ensuring a smooth transition. Over the long term, these adjustments
will transition into scenario-dependent projections that reflect different policy and climate pathways.
